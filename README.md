# Devinci Cracks - Web Attacks

## Description

This repository was made for an academic project in the context of a engineering
degree in specialization [Cloud Computing & Cybersecurity](https://www.esilv.fr/en/programmes/master-degree-engineering/majors/cybersecurity-cloud-computing/) at [Pôle Léonard de Vinci](https://www.esilv.fr/en/).

The goal was to simulate web vulnerabilities, exploit them and fix them.

## How to use the attacks

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

TODO: Polish details

We go on the XSS tab and click on "Go to unsecure" to go on the vulnerable version of the website, then in the form type `<scipt>alert("XSS attack!")</script>` and click on "Send" to see the alert pop up.
